            <hr>
            <p id="p1">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
            <p>The <b>anchor text</b>, <b>link label</b> or <b>link text</b> is the visible, clickable text in an <a
                    href="#">HTML hyperlink</a>. The term
                "anchor" was used in older versions of the HTML specification <sup>[1]</sup> for what is currently
                referred to as
                the <i>a element</i>, or a tag. <sup>[2]</sup> The HTML specification does not have a specific term for
                anchor text, but
                refers to it as "text that the a element wraps around". In <a href="#">XML</a> terms (since HTML is
                XML), the anchor
                text is the content of the element, provided that the content is text. <sup>[3]</sup>

                Usually, web search engines analyze anchor text from hyperlinks on web pages. The words contained in
                the anchor text can determine the <a href="#">ranking</a> that the page will receive from search
                engines. Other
                services apply the basic principles of anchor text analysis as well. For instance, <a href="#">academic
                    search
                    engines</a> may use <a href="#">citation</a> context to classify <a href="#">academic articles</a>,
                <sup>[4]</sup> and anchor text from documents
                linked in <a href="#">mind maps</a> may be used too. <sup>[5]</sup>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <a name="overview">
                <span class="overview">Overview</span><a href="#">[edit]</a></h1>
            </a>
            <hr>
            <p>Anchor text usually gives the user relevant descriptive or contextual information about the content of
                the link's destination. The anchor text may or may not be related to the actual text of the <a
                    href="#">URL</a> of the
                link. For example, a hyperlink to the <a href="#">English-language Wikipedia</a>'s <a
                    href="#">homepage</a> might take this form:</p>
            <br>
            <code>
                &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt; <a href="Wikipedia"></a> &lt;/a&gt;
            </code>
            <br><br>
            <p>"Wikipedia" is the anchor text in this example. The URL it points to is
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page. The entire hyperlink appears on a web page as Wikipedia.</p>
        <div class="search_engine_algorithms">
            <a name="search_engine_algorithms">
                <span class="search_engine_algorithms">Search engine algorithms</span><a href="#">[edit]</a></h1>
            </a>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Anchor text is weighted (ranked) highly in <a href="#">search engine algorithms</a>, because the linked
                text is usually
                relevant to the <a href="#">landing page</a>. The objective of search engines is to provide highly
                relevant search
                results; this is where anchor text helps, as the tendency was, more often than not, to hyperlink words
                relevant to the landing page. Anchor text can also serve the purpose of directing the user to internal
                pages on the site, which can also help to rank the website higher in the search rankings.<sup>[6]</sup>

                <a href="#">Webmasters</a> may use anchor text to procure high results in <a href="#">search engine
                    results pages. Google</a>'s
                <a href="#">Webmaster Tools</a> facilitate this optimization by letting <a href="#">website</a> owners
                view the most common words in
                anchor text linking to their site. <sup>[7]</sup> In the past, <a href="#">Google bombing</a> was
                possible through anchor text
                manipulation; however, in January 2007, Google announced it had updated its algorithm to minimize the
                impact of Google bombs, which refers to a prank where people attempt to cause someone else's site to
                rank for an obscure or meaningless query. <sup>[8]</sup>

                In April 2012, Google announced in its March "<a href="#">Penguin</a>" update that it would be changing
                the way it
                handled anchor text, implying that anchor text would no longer be as important an element for their
                ranking metrics. <sup>[9]</sup> Moving forward, Google would be paying more attention to a diversified
                link profile
                which has a mix of anchor text and other types of links. . <sup>[10]</sup>

                However a 2016 study of anchor text influence across 16,000 keywords found that presence of exact and
                partial match anchor links continues to have a strong correlation with Google rankings.

                August 2016 study conducted by Moz, found that Exact and partial match domains can be affected by over
                optimization penalty since Google considers domain Brand and naked URL links as Exact match.

                There are different classifications of anchor text that are used within the search engine optimization
                community such as the following: <br><br>

            <h3>Exact match</h3> <br>
            an anchor that is used with a keyword that mirrors the page that is being linked to. Example: " <a
                href="#">search
                engine optimization</a> " is an exact match anchor because it's linking to a page about "search engine
            optimization". <br><br>
            <h3>Partial match</h3> <br>
            an anchor that is used with a keyword and a variation that mirrors the page that is being linked to.
            Example: "different search engine optimization techniques" is a partial match anchor when it's linking
            to a page about " <a href="#">search engine optimization</a> ".<br><br>
            <h3>Branded</h3><br>
            a brand that is used as the anchor. " <a href="#">Wikipedia</a> " is a branded anchor text.<br><br>
            <h3>Naked link</h3><br>
            a URL that is used as an anchor. " <a href="#">www.wikipedia.com</a> " is a naked link anchor.<br><br>
            <h3>Generic</h3><br>
            a generic word or phrase that is used as the anchor. "Click here" is a generic anchor. Other variations
            may include "go here", "visit this website", etc.<br><br>
            <h3>Images</h3><br>
            whenever an image is linked, Google will use the <a href="#">"alt" attribute</a> as the anchor text.<br><br>
            <h3>Empty</h3><br>
            whenever an image is linked, and the "alt" attribute is empty.<br><br>
            <h3>Latent semantic indexing</h3><br>
            <a href="#">Latent semantic indexing</a> (LSI) is a method used by <a href="#">Google</a> to determine
            similar keywords.
